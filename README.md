# ✈️ British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience (Forage)
*A two-part analytics and machine learning project exploring airline booking behavior and customer review sentiment using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and real-world data science workflows.*

---

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my completed work from the **British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience** on Forage.  
It includes two complementary projects:

### **1. Booking Completion Analysis (Structured Data)**
Analyzing **50,000+ airline bookings** to identify the drivers of booking completion and build predictive models.

### **2. Skytrax Review Sentiment Analysis (Unstructured Text Data)**
Scraping, cleaning, and analyzing **British Airways customer reviews** to uncover sentiment patterns and common themes.

Together, these tasks demonstrate core skills in **Python, machine learning, web scraping, NLP, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis**.

# 1️⃣ Task 1 — Booking Completion Analysis  
**Files:**  
- `notebooks/task1_booking_eda.ipynb`  
- `notebooks/task1_booking_model.ipynb`  
- `data/customer_booking.csv`

### 🔍 Objective  
Use 50,000+ booking records to explore customer behavior and predict which bookings are likely to be completed.

### 🧠 Key Steps
- Performed exploratory analysis using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn  
- Cleaned and transformed features:
  - Encoded `flight_day`
  - Processed trip type and add-on preferences  
- Trained predictive models using scikit-learn:
  - One-hot encoding
  - Train/test split  
  - Random Forest classifier  
- Evaluated model performance and extracted feature importance

### ⭐ Findings
- **Purchase lead time** is a strong predictor of booking completion  
- **Sales channel** affects conversion behavior  
- Customer add-on interest (baggage, meals, seating) correlates with higher completion probability

# 2️⃣ Task 2 — Skytrax Review Sentiment Analysis  
**Files:**  
- `notebooks/task2_skytrax_sentiment.ipynb`  
- `notebooks/task2_skytrax_experiments.ipynb`  
- `data/BA_reviews.csv` (generated via scraping)  
- `slides/BA_customer_review_presentation.pptx`

### 🔍 Objective  
Scrape and analyze British Airways customer reviews from Skytrax to identify sentiment trends and common customer experience themes.

### 🧠 Key Steps
- Scraped multiple pages of reviews using **Requests** and **BeautifulSoup**  
- Cleaned text (lowercasing, regex, stopwords, lemmatization)  
- Applied **NLTK VADER** sentiment analysis to classify reviews  
- Visualized insights with:
  - WordCloud  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn bar charts  
- Exported results for presentation in PowerPoint

### ⭐ Findings
- Positive reviews slightly outweigh negative ones  
- Neutral reviews are rare — customers usually write when experiences are extreme  
- Common themes include:
  - **Staff service**  
  - **Comfort & seating**  
  - **Delays and punctuality**  
  - **Food & onboard experience**
